In Tetris Attack, it seems like a panel cannot match in the same frame
that it does some other state transition.  Right now this is implemented
for the "landing" state but not for the "normal" state or any other state.

In Tetris Attack, the rising of the stack is not smooth around displacement=0.
This part of the animation takes just as long regardless of speed.
This is most noticeable if you use L or R, the stack will sort of jitter on
its way up.  I have no plans to implement this.

In Tetris Attack, only one pair of panels can be swaping at any time, and
the new swap can only be created in some frames of the old swap.  This is
part of why it is easier to stealth in panel-attack.
I have no plans to implement either of these things, but I might need to
if I ever implement the first thing on this list.

In Tetris Attack, a stack of garbage that should all begin falling at the same
time will occasionally separate.  I have no plans to implement this.

In Tetris Attack, you get nothing for chains past 13.  I will probably
implement things for chains past 13.
