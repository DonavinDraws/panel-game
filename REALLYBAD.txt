REALLY BAD NETPLAY PROTOCOL TIME!

The server will accept connections!

The clients will perform a handshake like so:
Client connects to server and says "H" followed by a 3-digit protocol version number
    for example, "H139"
Server can reply...
    "H" (meaning you have to wait for an opponent)
        Server will later send "G" when game is beginning
    "G" (meaning the game is beginning)
    "N" (meaning FUCK YOU your protocol is out of date)

Whenever it likes, client will ask the server for panels by saying
"P" followed by a 1-digit number of colors and a 6-digit bottommost row of panels.
    for example, "P5524153"
    Server will reply with "P" followed by 120 randomly generated panels.
        Panels should be in the range from 1 to K inclusive where K is the number of colors.
    Server will tell the other client "O" followed by the same panels.

Each frame, client will send its input state to server by saying "I"
followed by 22 characters:
    6 digits to represent the frame number of the client, followed by 0 or 1 for keys:
        up, down, left, right, swap_1, swap_2, raise_1, raise_2,
        and the this_frame_keys versions of each of these.

At any time during gameplay, client must accept any number of these messages:
    "P" followed by 120 digits
        This is 20 new rows of panels for the client's play area.
    "O" followed by 120 digits
        This is 20 new rows of panels for the opponent's play area.
    "I" followed by 22 digits
        This is a 6-digit frame number followed by an input state.
        It represents a frame worth of the opponent's play.
    Eventually:
        "gg" followed by "w" or "l"
            The game is over.  You [w]on or you [l]ost.
