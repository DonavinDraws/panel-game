Notation
========

This file details the copyright status of its asset files and if available the related license the artwork has been made available for use.  
For brevity, all file paths are to be assumed to be located within the client/assets/ directory.
For brevity, individual contributions may be subsumed under the title "The Panel Attack Contributors" in some cases. This does not affect the copyright status, all the rights belong to the respective creator.
For brevity, directories may be addressed directly if the copyright and license status can be summarized for its contents. If a file is addressed by more than one entry, the most specific one applies. Copyright and license notice do not apply for non-artworks in directories addressed as such (e.g. configuration files).
For brevity, multiple entries may be made in succession to indicate the same creator and license status.
For brevity, notation may use common wildcards to indicate ownership and license for similarly named groups of files.
For brevity, some keywords are used that encompass groups of file that form a cohesive whole when put together in the game.
For brevity, names used in this file may address files by name only, meaning without both file extension (e.g. ".png") and scale indicator (e.g. "@2x")
Panel Attack attempts to use metadata in all of its assets under version control to indicate copyright status beyond this textual representation.
If metadata information of an asset version controlled in this repository contradicts this document, please assume a mistake has happened, open an issue and err on the side of caution regarding use.
If an asset is not tracked by this file and has no metadata information, similarly assume that all rights are reserved. In some cases a file may not be tracked because its content is not considered copyrightable by nature (e.g. themes/Panel Attack Modern/transparent.png)

  These have been licensed for embedding in Panel Attack releases according to the EULA from the Unity Asset Store and a license has been purchased via this URL:
  https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/sound-fx/interface-and-item-sounds-89646
  You cannot use them for any other purpose than embedding in Panel Attack.

  Additionally the situation on these is a bit unclear. The EULA suggests that it might be required for each developer to acquire their own license to work with the assets.
  However, the licensor of the assets, Cafofo Music, went completely missing and many of their asset packs have been taken down, presumably for copyright infringement.
  Unlike most other asset packs from this seller however, according to our insight this pack is still available for download for the anyone who originally purchased it. This indicates that it was not flagged for copyright and the mediator (Unity) considers these assets as lawfully acquired as otherwise continuing to host them would be an infringement itself.
  The conclusion is that we cannot obtain new licenses by fault of the licensor but the already acquired license is valid.
  Accordingly these assets should be replaced as soon as convenient or once the licensor becomes available again, maintainers shall obtain additional licenses, whichever is first.
