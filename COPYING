No license yet D:

This will probably be under MIT license or similar, pending Brandon's
consent to that sort of thing.
This or some other file should thank the people whose work I depend on:
    lua devs
    LOVE devs
    Brandon for making V3PdP
    Dr. Parberry for teaching the game dev
    Anyone who contributed after I put this on github
